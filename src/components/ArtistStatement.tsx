              Daniel (alias Dankoshi)
              Born near Madrid, grew up as the fifth of eight siblings in a modest family. His name reflects his lifelong passion for martial arts, combining "Dan" from his name and "Koshi" in tribute to Gichin Funakoshi, the founder of Shoto-kan karate.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed font-light">
              Later in life, Dankoshi discovered his love for painting, inspired by artist and priest Don Francisco Hern√°ndez. Starting as a self-taught painter, he drew influence from Kandinsky, exploring bold forms and emotional expression through oil on canvas.

              Dankoshi's art delves into life's raw emotions and daily realities, transforming them into visual stories. Each piece invites the viewer to uncover hidden characters, feelings, and narratives, sparking imagination and personal connection.
              Since 2015, the Dankoshi canvas collection has shared these journeys with the world, always reminding us of his motto: <span className="font-bold">"Put a Dankoshi in your life."</span>
